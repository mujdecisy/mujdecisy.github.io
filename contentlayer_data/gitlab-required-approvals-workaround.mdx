# Gitlab Required Approvals Count Workaround

If your side-project with your companions is nominated to be a big project, but not big enough to buy Gitlab/Github enterprise.
Then you will not be able to use some beautiful features of Gitlab/Github like protecting branches with minimum approvals count.
Here is a workaround for your project to achieve this feature over CI/CD steps.
This implementation is done directly on Gitlab, and you can implement same steps on Github too.

Simply you can run some job/workflow when there is a merge request to your protected branch.
It can be anything like running unittests, checks for formatting, deployment on your test servers to prepare that future for QA developers.
And you can set your MR to be possible only within some of these jobs done successfully.
So we can use this feature with the purpose of required approvals for an MR to a protected branch.

However this approach depends on trust in team, because you can simply break this flow by commiting on your job definitions.
Here is the instruction set for the implementation on Gitlab.

## 1. Create a Job/Workflow
This job will be triggered on `merge_request_event`s to gather some data from Gitlab REST API.
So we need some access token on our project's environment variables.

### 1.1 Create Your Access Token
Follow the link below to create a **personal access token**.
Gitlab does not allow **project access tokens** for now to gitlab.com free users,
however in case of being free in the future I left the link below.

- [Personal Access Token Document](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token)
- [Project Access Token Document](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html#create-a-project-access-token)

You must define scopes below for the access token.
- [x] api
- [x] read_user
- [x] read_api
- [x] read_repository

> Do not forget to copy your access token, you will not be able to do it after closing page.

### 1.2 Set Access Token as an Environment Variable
The one who make this settings must be the owner or maintainer of the project.
Set your copied access token as an environment variable which is named `ACCESS_TOKEN` and will be a masked variable.

- [Variable Definition](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#for-a-project)

The variable must be masked because we do not want to reveal our access token on job's output.
And other users must have role `developer`, otherwise they can reveal your access token on settings page.


### 1.3 Create an Approval-Check Step on Your CI



## 2. Create a bash file
I named it `.gitlab-approval.sh` and located it in the root of repo folder.
This bash file will do some checks on your MR over Gitlab REST API.
